NOTEWORTHY CHANGES SINCE v2.2.0b
================================

User-visible changes
--------------------

* Constraints have been made penetrable.

* The automatic obj-directories have been removed. If you want to use
  object directories, just change to the directory and call configure
  from there. This change made the whole build system much more GNU
  compliant and easier to maintain.

* The Espresso wrapper scripts have disappeared, and Espresso_bin has
  been renamed to Espresso. The directory where the scripts are
  installed is now compiled into the binary, i.e. it is not necessary
  anymore to set the environment variable ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS. Still, it
  will heed the environment variable if it is set.

Organizational changes
----------------------

* The home page of ESPReSso has been relocated to

    http://espressomd.org

* The mailing list and source code repository have been moved to GNU
  Savannah. Furthermore, we have a bugtracker now. The development
  homepage is 

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/espressomd

* The maintenance of ESPResSo has been relocated from Torsten St√ºhn
  from the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research at Mainz to 

    Olaf Lenz <olenz@icp.uni-stuttgart.de>

  from the Institute for Computational Physics at Stuttgart University.

* The old "ESPResSo license" was removed, as it was not really a
  license, but only contained additions that were either non-binding
  or already contained in the GPL.

* The license was upgraded to GPLv3.

* The package was adapted to GNU standards. RELEASE_NOTES was moved
  aside to old/RELEASE_NOTES, instead, we will have the files
  ChangeLog and NEWS. NEWS will contain a description of the most
  noteworthy changes since the last release.

* The build system has been overhauled and simplified.  Some options
  to configure are gone.

Changes visible for developers
------------------------------

* The source code repository has been moved from CVS to git, and it
  has moved to GNU Savannah (see above).

* All functions that represent the interface to Tcl should follow the
  same naming conventions. These are described here:

    git log 3d4d6f31655a8d96e47c8f80e10f27f6b764f8df
