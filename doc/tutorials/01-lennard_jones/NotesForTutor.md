# Hints for Tutors: Tutorial 01 - Lennard Jones

## Learning objectives (physics):

After the tutorial, students should be able to 

* explain
    * role of Lennard-Jones potential
    * role of radial distribution function
    * connection between mean squared displacement and diffusion coefficient
    * how to use an auto correlation function to estimate correlation times and how that affects error estimation


## Learning objectives (Espresso)

After the tutorial, students should be able to 

* instance a simulation object and set basic parameters like time step
* add particles to a simulation, 
* access and change particle properties
* set up non-bonded interactions
* explain the role of particle type
* remove overlap using steepest descent
* setting up a thermostat
* integrating and collecting data
* explain the basic concept of observables and accumulators

## Points to mention throughout the tutorial

* Re-explain Langevin equation
* Mention efficiency (loops and lists) vs. numpy arrays at the cost of some readability.
