    "This tutorial introduces the basic features for simulating titratable systems via the constant pH method.\n",

    "Note that $K$ is a dimensionless quantity but its numerical value depends on the choice of $c^0$.\n",
    "For an ideal system, $\\gamma_i=0$ by definition, whereas for an interacting system $\\gamma_i$ is a non-trivial function of the interactions. Therefore, for an ideal system we can rewrite $K$ in terms of equilibrium concentrations\n",
