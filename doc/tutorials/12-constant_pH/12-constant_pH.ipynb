    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the basic features for simulating titratable systems via the constant pH method.\n",
    "The constant pH method is one of the methods implemented for simulating systems with chemical reactions within the Reaction Ensemble module. It is a Monte-Carlo method designed to model an acid-base ionization reaction at a given (fixed) value of solution pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a homogeneous aqueous solution of a titratable acidic species $\\mathrm{HA}$ that can dissociate in a reaction, that is characterized by the equilibrium constant $\\mathrm{p}K_A=-\\log_{10} K_A$\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{HA} \\Leftrightarrow \\mathrm{A}^- + \\mathrm{H}^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N_0 = N_{\\mathrm{HA}} + N_{\\mathrm{A}^-}$ is the number of titratable groups in solution, then we define the degree of dissociation $\\alpha$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha = \\dfrac{N_{\\mathrm{A}^-}}{N_0}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the key quantities that can be used to describe the acid-base equilibrium. Usually, the goal of the simulation is to predict the value of $\\alpha$ under given conditions in a complex system with interactions. In this tutorial, we will simulate only ideal systems (without intermolecular interactions) to show that in such case our simulations reproduce the well-known analytical solutions."

    "Note that $K$ is a dimensionless quantity but its numerical value depends on the choice of $c^0$.\n",

    "### 1.2 Constant pH Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant pH method [Reed1992] is designed to simulate an acid-base ionization reaction at a given pH. It assumes that the simulated system is coupled to an implicit reservoir of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions but exchange of ions with this reservoir is not explicitly simulated. Therefore, the number of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ ions in the simulation box does not correspond to the chosen pH. This may lead to artifacts when simulating interacting systems, especially at high of low pH values. Discussion of these artifacts is beyond the scope of this tutorial (see e.g. [Landsgesell2019] for further details).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Espresso, the forward step of the ionization reaction (from left to right) is implemented by \n",
    "changing the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{HA}$ particle to $\\mathrm{A}^-$, and inserting another particle that represents $\\mathrm{H}^+$. In the reverse direction (from right to left), the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ is changed to $\\mathrm{HA}$, and a randomly selected $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is deleted from the simulation box. The probability of proposing the  forward reaction step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{HA}/N_0$, and probability of proposing the reverse step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{A}/N_0$.

    "### 3.1 Statistical Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular simulation produces a sequence of snapshots of the system, that \n",
    "constitute a Markov chain. It is a sequence of realizations of a random process, where\n",
    "the next value in the sequence depends on the preceding one. Therefore,\n",
    "the subsequent values are correlated. To estimate statistical error of the averages\n",
    "determined in the simulation, one needs to correct for the correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a rudimentary way of correcting for correlations, termed the binning method.\n",
    "We refer the reader to specialized literature for a more sophisticated discussion [Janke2002]. The general idea is to group a long sequence of correlated values into a rather small number of blocks, and compute an average per each block. If the blocks are big enough, they\n",
    "can be considered uncorrelated, and one can apply the formula for standard error of the mean of uncorrelated values. If the number of blocks is small, then they are uncorrelated but the obtained error estimates has a high uncertainty. If the number of blocks is high, then they are too short to be uncorrelated, and the obtained error estimates are systematically lower than the correct value. Therefore, the method works well only if the sample size is much greater than the autocorrelation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we use a fixed number of 8 blocks to obtain the error estimates. To check for consistency, we estimate the autocorrelation time, and print a warning message if some blocks contain less than 100 uncorrelated values. Intentionally, we make our simulation slightly too short, so that it does not produce enough uncorrelated samples. We encourage the reader to vary the number of blocks or the number of samples to see how the estimated error changes with these parameters."

For 68% of the results, the deviation from the analytical result should be within the error bar, whereas about 95% of the results should be within two times the error bar. Indeed, if you plot the deviations by running the script below, you should observe that most of the results are within one error bar from the analytical solution, a smaller fraction  of the results is slightly further than one error bar, and one or two might be about two error bars apart.\n",

    "Naively, one would expect the value of $-\\log_{10} (c_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} / c_0)$ to be equal to the pH value specified as input of the simulation but this is not true. The only $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions in the simulation box are those that have been generated by the ionization reaction. Therefore, the number of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions increases with increasing ionization (increasing pH on the input), and converserly the value of $-\\log_{10} (c_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} / c_0)$ decreases with increasing pH on the input. Moreover, the value of $-\\log_{10} (c_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} / c_0)$ depends not only on the ionization degree but also on the total concentration of ionizable species. Therefore, at high pH, the value of $-\\log_{10} (c_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} / c_0)$ converges to the logarithm of concentration of ionizable species, and does not vary with input pH anymore. This demonstrates, that in the Constant-pH ensemble, the value of $-\\log_{10} (c_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} / c_0)$, and the pH provided as input, should be viewed as two independent parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal system, this discrepancy between the value of $-\\log_{10} (c_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} / c_0)$ and input pH values is harmless because the acceptance probability in the constant-pH ensemble does not depend on the actual number of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions in the box. In an interacting system, the presence of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions in the box affects the properties of other parts of the system. Therefore, in an interacting system this discrepancy is harmless only if $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions are the minority component among other ionic species. See also [Landsgesell2019] for a more detailed discussion of this issue, and its consequences.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Try changing the concentration of ionizable species in the non-interacting system. You should observe that it does not affect the obtained titration curve but it affects the pH value measured from the concentration of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions in the simulation box\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try changing the number of samples and the number of particles to see how the estimated error and the number of uncorrelated samples will change. Be aware that if the number of uncorrelated samples is low, the error estimation is too optimistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try running the same simulations with steric repulsion and then again with electrostatic interactions. Observe how the ionization equilibrium is affected by various interactions. Warning: simulations with electrostatics are much slower. If you want to obtain your results quickly, then decrease the number of pH values."
