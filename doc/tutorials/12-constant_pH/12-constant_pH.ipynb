    "This tutorial introduces the basic features for simulating titratable systems via the constant pH method.\n",

    "This is one of the key quantities that can be used to describe the acdi-base equilibrium. Usually, the goal of the simulation is to predict the value of $\\alpha$ under given conditions in a complex system with intearctions. In this tutorial, we will simulate only ideal systems (without intermolecular interactions) to show that in such case our simulations reproduce the well-known analytical solutions."

    "Note that $K$ is a dimensionless quantity but its numerical value depends on the choice of $c^0$.\n",
    "For an ideal system, $\\gamma_i=0$ by definition, whereas for an interacting system $\\gamma_i$ is a non-trivial function of the interactions. Therefore, for an ideal system we can rewrite $K$ in terms of equilibrium concentrations\n",

Discussion of these artifacts is beyond the scope of this tutorial (see e.g. Ref.[1] for further details).\n",

In the reverse direction (from right to left), the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ is changed to $\\mathrm{HA}$, and a randomly selected $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is deleted from the simulation box. The probability of proposing the  forward reaction step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{HA}/N_0$, and probability of proposing the reseverse step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{A}/N_0$  [1].

Moreover, if the reactant list has more species than the products list, reactant molecules in excess are deleted from the system, while if the products list has more species than the reactants list, product molecules in excess are created and randomly placed inside the simulation box. For example, reversing the order of products in our reaction (i.e. from  `product_types=[type_H, type_A]` to `product_types=[type_A, type_H]`), a neutral monomer would be positively charged and a negatively charged monovalent counterion would be randomly placed inside the cell.\n",
