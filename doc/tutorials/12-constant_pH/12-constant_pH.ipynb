    "### 1.2 Constant pH Method\n",

    "The constant pH method [Reed1992] is designed to simulate an acid-base ionization reaction at a given pH. It assumes that the simulated system is coupled to an implicit reservoir of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions but exchange of ions with this reservoir is not explicitly simulated. Therefore, the number of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ ions in the simulation box does not correspond to the chosen pH. This may lead to artifacts when simulating interacting systems, especially at high of low pH values. Discussion of these artifacts is beyond the scope of this tutorial (see e.g. [Landsgesell2019] for further details).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Espresso, the forward step of the ionization reaction (from left to right) is implemented by \n",
    "changing the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{HA}$ particle to $\\mathrm{A}^-$, and inserting another particle that represents $\\mathrm{H}^+$. In the reverse direction (from right to left), the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ is changed to $\\mathrm{HA}$, and a randomly selected $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is deleted from the simulation box. The probability of proposing the  forward reaction step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{HA}/N_0$, and probability of proposing the reseverse step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{A}/N_0$. The trial move is accepted with the acceptance probability\n",

If the reactant list has more species than the product list, then excess reactant species are deleted from the system.

    "### 3.1 Statistical Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular simulation produces a sequence of snapshots of the system, that \n",

    "the next value in the sequence depends on the preceding one. Therefore,\n",
    "the subsequent values are correlated. To estimate statistical error of the averages\n",
    "determined in the simulation, one needs to correct for the correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a rudimentary way of correcting for correlations, termed the binning method.\n",
    "We refer the reader to specialized literature for a more sophisticated discussion [cite Janke]. The general idea is to group a long sequence of correlated values into a rather small number of blocks, and compute an average per each block. If the blocks are big enough, they\n",
    "can be considered uncorrelated, and one can apply the formula for standard error of the mean of uncorrelated values. If the number of blocks is small, then they are uncorrelated but the obtained error estimates has a high uncertainty. If the number of blocks is high, then they are too short to be uncorrelated, and the obtained error estimates are systematically lower than the correct value. Therefore, the method works well only if the sample size is much greater than the autocorrelation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we use a fixed number of 8 blocks to obtain the error estimates. To check for consistency, we estimate the autocorrelation time, and print a warning message if some blocks contain less than 100 uncorrelated values. Intentionally, we make our simulation slightly too short, so that it does not produce enough uncorrelated samples. We encourage the reader to vary the number of blocks or the number of samples to see how the estimated error changes with these parameters."
