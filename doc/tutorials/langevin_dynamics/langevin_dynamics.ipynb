    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you are going to learn about Langevin dynamics. It is a very easy and therefore widely used technique for two main reasons:\n",
    "* As a thermostat. You can use Langevin dynamics to run the system at a certain temperature, including the expected fluctuations of the total energy.\n",
    "* To include hydrodynamic interactions of suspended particles with the solvent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, you will always do both: Langevin thermostats will always include hydrodynamic friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a single spherical colloidal particle in a fluid. Due to the absence of further particles and external fields, this particle experiences Brownian motion as a result of the interaction with the solvent molecules. While structural relaxation times for molecular fluids are of the order of $10^{-14}s$, relevant time scales for Brownian particles are known to be in the order of $10^{-9}s$. The distinction between slow and fast degrees of freedom allows to describe the motion of the colloidal particle in terms of the Langevin equation. This equation of motion describes the apparent random movement of the particle in the fluid and is given by \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    m\\dot{{\\bf v}}(t)=-\\gamma {\\bf v}(t)+{\\bf f}(t).\n",
    "    \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $m$ denotes the particle mass and ${\\bf v}(t)$ its velocity. Equation (1) arises from Newton's equation of motion considering that the interaction of the spherical Brownian particle with the solvent has two contributions: 1- a friction force, which is proportional to the velocity of the particle, for not too large velocities, with proportionality constant equal to the friction constant $\\gamma$; and 2- a rapidly varying force ${\\bf f}(t)$ with the time due to the the random collisions of the solvent molecules with the surface of the Brownian particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a macroscopically large spherical particle, $\\gamma$ is given by the Stokes' law\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\gamma = 6\\pi\\eta_0a,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "with $\\eta_0$ the shear viscosity of the fluid and $a$ the radius of the Brownian particle. The ensemble average of the fluctuating force ${\\bf f}(t)$ vanishes, \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\langle {\\bf f}(t)\\rangle = 0,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "since the systematic interaction with the fluid is made explicit in the friction term. Owing to the separation in time scales, there is no correlation between impacts in any distinct time intervals. Thus, the second moments of ${\\bf f}$ satisfy \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\langle f_i(t)f_j(t')\\rangle =2\\gamma k_\\text{B}T \\delta_{i,j}\\delta(t-t'),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where one can see that the strength of the fluctuation force depends on the friction coefficient and the system temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since only ensemble averaged properties of ${\\bf f}$ are specified, it make no sense to look at a single deterministic solution of Eq. (1), but ensemble averaged quantities that characterize the dynamics of the spherical Brownian particle. The simplest quantity is the so-called mean square displacement (MSD) after time $\\tau$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{MSD}(\\tau)=\\langle |{\\bf r}(t+\\tau)-{\\bf r}(t)|^2\\rangle.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "From integration of  Eq. (1) and considering that ${\\bf v}(t)=\\dot{{\\bf r}}(t)$, one can obtain that\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{MSD}(\\tau)=6D\\tau\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "for $\\tau\\gg m/\\gamma$, where the diffusion coefficient $D$ is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    D=\\frac{k_\\text{B}T}{\\gamma}.\n",
