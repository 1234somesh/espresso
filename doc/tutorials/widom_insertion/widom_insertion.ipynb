    "\n",
    "The combination of Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamic simulations offers many possibilities beyond using each technique solely on their own.\n",
    "In general, MD simulations are restricted to relatively small time scales and, depending on the modeled interactions, to rather small particle numbers as well.\n",
    "However, they have the advantage of computing collective particle movements with the correct dynamics.\n",
    "The time between two MD steps is bound by the fastest motion of the system of interest (for all-atom MD, those are atomic vibrations).\n",
    "\n",
    "MC simulations, on the other hand, do not have such limitations.\n",
    "Even nonphysical moves can be considered, still leading to results with correct thermodynamic properties.\n",
    "However, no valuable information of the system's dynamics can be obtained.\n",
    "The combination of MD and MC moves allows us to mimic any ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will compute the chemical potential of a monovalent salt solution by using a combination of MD and MC techniques.\n",
    "The chemical potential is important for simulating chemical equilibria and systems where particles can be exchanged with an external reservoir, which is too large to be simulated explicitly, or between two subsystems."

    "In a pure MD simulation, there is no direct way to access the chemical potential, since it is related to changes in the particle number, which is fixed in an MD simulation.\n",
    "In 1963, Widom proposed a MC scheme to measure the chemical potential in a system using trial particle insertions <a href='#[1]'>[1]</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical potential for species $\\alpha$ is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mu_{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_\\alpha} \\right)_{p,T,N_{\\beta\\neq\\alpha}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N_\\alpha}\\right)_{V,T,N_{\\beta\\neq\\alpha}} \\quad .\\tag{1}\n",
    "  \\label{eq:chem_pot_def}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "It corresponds to the difference in the Helmholtz free energy $F$ or Gibbs free energy $G$ for bringing a particle from infinity into the system, or equally for removing one particle, thus changing the particle number $N_\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical partition function is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  Z(N,V,T)=\\frac{V^N}{\\Lambda^{3N}N!} \\int_{\\left[0,1\\right]^{3N}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta U\\left(\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{s}^i\\right\\}\\right)\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{s}^1\\ldots\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{s}^N  \\quad ,\\tag{2}\n",
    "  \\label{eq:partition_function}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where V is the volume, $\\Lambda=h/\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_\\mathrm{B}T}$ the thermal wavelength, $\\beta$ the inverse temperature, $U$ the interaction potential and $\\boldsymbol{s}^i$ the rescaled (dimensionless) particle coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Helmholtz free energy $F$ can be computed from the partition function: $F=-k_BT\\ln\\left(Z(N,V,T)\\right)$.\n",
    "For sufficiently large N, the following relation approximates the chemical potential:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mu & = -k_\\mathrm{B}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z(N+1,V,T)}{Z(N,V,T)}\\right) \\label{eq:mu_limit_largeN}\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mu_\\textrm{ideal}$ depends only on the density of the system, so it is a constant for systems with different interactions but the same particle density.\n",
    "The interesting part is the excess chemical potential $\\mu_\\textrm{ex}$, which can be expressed in a form involving a canonical average:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mu-\\mu_\\textrm{ideal}=\\mu_\\textrm{ex}=-k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln\\left(\\int_{\\left[0,1\\right]^{3}}\\langle\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta U)\\rangle\\,\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{s}^{N+1}\\right)\\quad .\\tag{4}\n",
    "  \\label{eq:mu_ex}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    " \n",
    "In the above expression, $\\Delta U$ is the energy difference of the system before and after the insertion of a test particle at a random position.\n",
    "The value of the integral in this equation can be computed in a simulation in the canonical ensemble (e.g. using Langevin dynamics) by averaging over many configurations of the system (corresponding to the average $\\langle ...\\rangle$) and many positions of the trial insertion (corresponding to the integral).\n",
    "\n",
    "The system under consideration here consists of $N$ monovalent ion pairs in an implicit solvent with $\\epsilon_\\text{r} = 78$, which is a simple model (``restricted primitive model'') for an aqueous salt solution of e.g. NaCl.\n",
    "In order to avoid that particles overlap, the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential is used.\n",
    "In the unit system employed in the simulations, the following parameters will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\lambda_b=2.0\\,,\\quad k_BT=1.0\\,,\\quad z_i=1.0\\,,\\quad N=N_i=50\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the investigated system is a monovalent salt the concentrations (and thus, densities) of positive and negative ions are the same.\n",
    "The method of Widom insertion introduced can be used to calculate the excess chemical potential for this system.\n",
    "However, we can not calculate the excess chemical potential of a single ion (a quantitity that is also not accessible in experiments) but only that of an ion pair, which is given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\mu_\\textrm{ex}^\\textrm{pair} = \\mu_\\textrm{ex}^+ + \\mu_\\textrm{ex}^- =\n",
